# Terminal-Based-Text-Editor

### I have chosen this project because it made me curious how will I manage file from terminal and I think 3rd problem is also on same concept but 2nd problem I think is little bit hard.

### Outline are as follows:

#### I will first find how to take input in Javascript and Node so for that I found 3 libraries blessed, ink, and node-ncurses.
##### These libraries are used to create a text box that supports text input, navigation, and editing. Users can navigate through the text using arrow keys or vi-style keybindings, insert and delete text, and submit changes by pressing Enter.

#### As text manipulation will be taken care by these libraries only, will then try to take input and save it somewhere so that while saving or after saving I can apply my DSA logic for search and replace functionality. 

#### will be using dynamic array as value of a key in HashMap to store words which user enters.

#### string matching algorithm I have not decided yet.
